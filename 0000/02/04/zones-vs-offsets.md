# Introduction

## UTC

- Reference time zone
- Monotonic-ish (what's a few leap seconds between friends?)

## Time zones vs. Offsets <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

<ul class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
    <li><tt>UTC-6</tt> is an offset</li>
    <li><tt>America/Chicago</tt> is a time zone</tt></li>
    <li><tt>CST</tt> is a highly context-dependent abbreviation:
        <ul>
            <li>Chicago Standard Time (<tt>UTC-6</tt>)</li>
            <li>Cuba Standard Time (<tt>UTC-5</tt>)</li>
            <li>China Standard Time (<tt>UTC+8</tt>)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
<ul>

Notes:

Before we start in on the history of time zones in Python, it's probably a good idea to give you a little tour of the problem we're trying to solve.

We can start out easy, with UTC. UTC is the reference time zone, it's the 0 against which offsets are measured. It is mostly monotonic â€” which is to say that it doesn't have daylight saving time. It still has leap seconds, which is infuriating, since leap seconds don't belong in civil time *at all*, much less in the reference time zone, but I think the damage is done there.

Another concept that is important to know is the difference between time zones and offsets.

UTC-6 is an offset. It means that you should add 6 hours to the local time to get a time in UTC.

`America/Chicago` is a time zone - it's a set of rules for what offsets and abbreviations apply in a given region as a function of time.

`CST`, which is the abbreviation for the offset that applies in Chicago right now, is a highly context-dependent abbreviation referring to an offset. In our context, it means Central Standard Time, but if you're in Cuba, it refers to Cuba Standard Time, and if you're in China, it refers to China standard time. Word of advice: never rely on these 3-letter abbreviations. Don't rely on them meaning a specific thing, and don't even rely on every zone having an associated 3-letter abbreviation.
