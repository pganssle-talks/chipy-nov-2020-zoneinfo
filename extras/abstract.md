Python 3.9 introduces the [`zoneinfo`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zoneinfo.html) module, which brings concrete time zone support to the standard library.

In this talk, I'll discuss the history of time zone support in Python, make the case for migrating your code to `zoneinfo`, and hopefully give you an understanding of everything you'll need to know to successfully make use of the new module.
